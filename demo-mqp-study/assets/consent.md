## Title of Research Study: Student Loan Repayment Simulation
### Introduction
You are being asked to participate in a research study. Before you agree, however, you must be
fully informed about the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits,
risks or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your participation. This form presents
information about the study so that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your
participation. <br> <br>

### Purpose of the study:
The purpose of this study is to evaluate how visualization aids in student loan repayment
planning. For new graduates, repaying student loans can seem daunting, and they may struggle to
understand how their payments impact their overall balance. Our study aims to determine if
visualization is an effective tool for helping borrowers understand how to pay off their loans
more efficiently. <br> <br>

### Procedures to be followed:
You will engage with an online survey that contains a loan repayment simulation. The
anticipated time required is about 10-15 minutes. You will be presented with a theoretical
scenario in which you have recently graduated and have a student loan to pay back. You must
decide how much to pay back of this loan each year, while considering other budgetary needs
(such as housing, food, and transportation). As the simulation progresses, you may have the option
to interact with a visualization and see how paying more or less money each month will affect
the loan balance at the end of the year. <br> <br>

### Risks to study participants:
There is minimal foreseeable risk to participants. Participants may not feel comfortable sharing
personal information surrounding their student loans, but we attempt to mitigate this risk by
collecting data anonymously and without the use of personal identifiers. <br> <br>

### Benefits to research participants and others:
Through taking part in this study, you may become more knowledgeable about loan repayment
strategies and the general process of student loan repayment. <br> <br>

### Record keeping and confidentiality:
The data collected during this study will be stored on the ReVISit platform on the cloud. Only
team members have access to this data and must log in to the platform using previously
established credentials. We expect to report data on demographics of the participant population,
the decisions that participants made during the simulation, and the answers to the general
financial literacy questions. <br>
Records of your participation in this study will be held confidential so far as permitted by law.
However, the study investigators, the sponsor or itâ€™s designee and, under certain circumstances,
the Worcester Polytechnic Institute Institutional Review Board (WPI IRB) will be able to inspect
and have access to confidential data that identify you by name. Any publication or presentation
of the data will not identify you. <br> <br>

### Compensation or treatment in the event of injury:
This research involves only minimal risk, and therefore no compensation is available in the event
of injury or harm. You do not give up any of your legal rights by signing this statement. <br> <br>
