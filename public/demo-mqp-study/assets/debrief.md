# Thank You For Completing This Study

 Thank you for your participation in our study. The main purpose of our study was to see how different representations affect people's loan repayment strategies. 


 In this study you were randomly assigned a visual representation of student loan repayment over 10 years. Visualizations included bar charts, stacked money bar chart, and pie charts. We collected how much was paid each year as well as metadata such as how long you spent on the study. 

 This study investigates which visualization tools are most effective to help borrowers. As real student loan debt rises, understanding how borrowers choose to make long term commitments becomes increasingly important.

If you have any questions about this study, feel free to reach out to us at gr-BEDVis@wpi.edu or to our advisors, Daniel Reichman (dreichman@wpi.edu) and Lane Harrison (ltharrison@wpi.edu).

Thank you for your time.
