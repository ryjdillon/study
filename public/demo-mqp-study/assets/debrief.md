# Thank You For Completing This Study

 Thank you for your participation in our study. The main purpose of our study was to see how viewing visuals or text affected people's loan repayment strategies. 

 In this study you were randomly assigned a either a visual or textual representation of student loan repayment over 10 years. The data we collected included how you chose to pay each year as well as metadata (such as how long you spent on the study). 

 This study investigates whether visualization tools are effective to help borrowers in repaying their loans. As the student loan debt crisis increases in scale, understanding how borrowers choose to repay their loans becomes increasingly important.

If you have any questions about this study, feel free to reach out to us at gr-BEDVis@wpi.edu or to our advisors, Daniel Reichman (dreichman@wpi.edu) and Lane Harrison (ltharrison@wpi.edu).
