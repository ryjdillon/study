# Introduction

You recently graduated WPI, and are starting a new job with an annual salary of $80,000. Along with \
your new career, you have a $30,000 student loan to pay off. The loan didn't accrue
any interest while \
you were in school, but now has an annual rate of 6.5%. 
In this simulation, you will be asked to decide\
 during each year of the loan's life what your monthly payment will be for that year.
